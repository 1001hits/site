This folder is meant to contain all your files for experimentation and testing purposes. The contents can be modified as per your wish, and the changes won't be tracked by Git, except the README file.

This Readme file is required to be added into the folder so that it can be added to Git.
NOTE: Don't delete/modify the contents of this README file. If you require a README file for your purposes, then create a folder inside this `temp` folder and put `your README` file there.
